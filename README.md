# Automatic Document Classification

This program implements an extension of the k-Nearest Neighbors Automatic Document Classification (kNN ADC) technique developed in the paper "Efficient and Scalable MetaFeature-based Document Classification using Massively Parallel Computing" [[1]](#1).

This program extended the kNN ADC technique by modifying the term and document norms and weights when computing the similarity values for each term document pair in a query document to documents in a training set containing these terms.

This program consists of a python script, which generates the term-document pairs, term-frequencies, and term-norms for each document in the training set, and a CUDA program that classifies a query document using parallel computing techniques.
